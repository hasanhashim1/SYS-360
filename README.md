Welcome to NET-SEC-SYS-480

###  Description
Cloud computing has become increasingly central to Information Security (IS) strategies both at the corporate and personal level. It unifies a variety of technologies to provide businesses with a method to improve business efficiency and reduce costs. This course will  provide students with knowledge they need to approach security in the cloud. We will start with a brief introduction to cloud computing and then jump in to cloud data security, infrastructure, and application security, etc. . This course was designed using coursework from ISC2 and the Cloud Security Alliance, two of the current leaders in this area.


### Student-Centered Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to: 

*   Learn the building blocks of cloud based systems.
*   Understand the concepts, principles, structures, and standards used to design, implement, monitor, and secure operating systems.
*   Develop knowledge of the cloud infrastructure components, both physical and virtual, existing threats, and mitigating and developing plans to deal with those threats.
*   Ability to identify issues to ensure that the need for training and awareness in application security, the process involved with cloud software assurance and validation.
*   Understand the processes to identify critical information and the execution of selected measures that eliminate or reduce adversary exploitation of critical information.
*   Analyze the legal and compliance aspect of cloud computing security as it relates to ethical behavior and compliance with regulatory frameworks.
*   Develop a sound understanding of cloud security tools, attacks, and various penetration methods.
